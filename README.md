# Airline Reservation System
### Goals:
Create a seat reservation system for an airline. Plan flight schedules between airports based on the data file to accommodate maximum passengers, maintaining a high average seat occupancy rate per day.

### Outcomes:
Created a reservation system that accomplishes the following:
1. Identifies passengers by a passenger ID that can be retrieved with all personal information given in the data file.
2. Make seat arrangements defined by three classes (economy, business, and first class).
3. Identifies airports by IATA codes.
4. Creates and books flights by departure time, origin airport, and destination airport.
5. Reserves seats for each passenger on a first come first served basis. These reservations allow automatic upgrades to the next available upper-level class or downgrades to the next available lower-level class if the requested class is full to accommodate all co-passengers.
6. Reports the number of available seats in each class on a given flight.
7. Indicates whether the passenger checked-in for the flight within the 24-hours prior to take-off.
